# github-activity-histo-message

This repository contains tools to generate a contribution graph message on GitHub by creating backdated git commits.

## Tools

### 1. `generate_commits.py`

This script calculates the necessary commit dates to form the message "USE AMPS" (or whatever is configured in the script) on your GitHub contribution graph. It generates a bash script `make_history.sh` that performs the actual commits.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Generate the commit script
python3 generate_commits.py

# Run the generated script to create commits
bash make_history.sh
```

### 2. `clear_history.py`

This script removes the commits generated by the tool. It looks for the most recent commit that does not match the "Pixel X,Y" pattern and resets the branch to that state.

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 clear_history.py
```

**Note:** This tool assumes the generated commits are at the tip of your branch. If you have made other commits on top of the generated ones, `clear_history.py` will refuse to run to prevent accidental data loss.
